# Who am I? <h2>
My name is **Olivia Rodriguez** and I am currently a Junior at Franklin D. Roosevelt High School. I play varsity softball for my school. I have always wanted to play softball because I grew up knowing the game. My dad and brother are both coaches for Men's League in Grand Prairie and Oakcliff. I am also in the Roosevelt H-tech Collegiate Academy. Although it is hard work, I enjoy working with computers, and I am interested in engineering. I like the idea of fixing things and understanding how things work. Recently, I have been interested in Avionics, but I will still have to explore my options. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas; however, I want to move away from Dallas for at least a couple years. I plan on moving to Los Angeles to get away from the same old people and routines I'm used to. I want to venture out into the world and do new things. In addition to that, I have 3 siblings: a sister and two brothers. I am the youngest. I also have three nieces: Kylee, Addison, and Alonnah. I want to be a good example and help them with school.

My top favorite colleges are:

- UNT
- SFA
- TCU
My goals in life are:

1. make my family proud
2. finish college
3. get a career
# What am I doing here? <h2>
When I heard about the collegiate academy at Roosevelt High School, I was in middle school at Oliver Wendell Holmes. I was immediately interested because, with a lot of work, I would be getting my Associates degree for free. ~Also, when I go to college, I would get my Bachelors degree in two years.~ I am here to prove people wrong. There is a lot of people in my life who have just messed up and I don't want that for myself. **I want to make my family proud by accomplishing my goals in this program.** Most of my family didn't attend college, so by doing this, I hope I can set an example for my nieces, nephews, and my own kids someday. This is the foundation for the rest of my life, and it is the best opportunity that I ever had.

# Where will you take this experience? <h2>
I am planning on taking my skills to my future career. I want to go to college first and *further my understanding of basic engineering*. I believe that I will be able to use my skills to benefit others. I want to use my mind to make the world around me better.
